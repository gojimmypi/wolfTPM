|                  | SDA             | SCL           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| ESP I2C Master   | I2C_MASTER_SDA | I2C_MASTER_SCL |
| TPM2 Device      | SDA            | SCL            |

For the actual default value of `I2C_MASTER_SDA` and `I2C_MASTER_SCL` see `Example Configuration` in `menuconfig`.

**Note:** There's no need to add an external pull-up resistors for SDA/SCL pin, because the driver will enable the internal pull-up resistors.
